## Development

To Test to application environment, you may choose to use docker. a suggestion would be to use the offical [odoo docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/odoo).

There you would find a sample of a `docker-compose.yml` file if you prefer to use `docker-compose`.

To add the module to the odoo container addons simply mount the location of the module to `mnt\extra-addons` like in the sample below.

```docker-composer.yml

version: '3.1'
services:
  web:
    image: odoo:14.0
    depends_on:
      - db
    ports:
      - "8069:8069"
    volumes:
      - odoo-web-data:/var/lib/odoo
      - ../:/mnt/extra-addons
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    user: root
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=odoo
      - POSTGRES_USER=odoo
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
    restart: always             # run as a service
    volumes:
        - ./postgresql:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  adminer:
    image: adminer
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8066:8080

volumes:
  odoo-web-data:
